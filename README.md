# Learning javascript design patterns

The ES6 versions of Addy Osmani's Learing Javascript Design Patterns examples

See the original book here: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/

I transpiled his ES5 examples to ES6 to acatually learn these great patterns. Maybe it helps you too.

The patterns are placed in dedicated subdirectories in the `/patterns` directory. 

The unit tests are written with mocha and located in  /test, run them with `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha` command. Don't forget to run `npm install` beforhand.

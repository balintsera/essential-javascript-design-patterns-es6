# Learning javascript design patterns

The ES6 versions of Addy Osmani's Learing Javascript Design Patterns examples

See the original book here: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/

I transpile his ES5 examples to ES6 to acatually learn these beautifull patterns. Maybe it helps you too.

The patterns are located in the subdirectories, for example the observer pattern in the `observer`. 

The unit tests are written with mocha and located in  /test, run them with `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha` command.
